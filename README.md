## What is this repository?
This repository details a project I made as my Highschool Capstone project. The repo exists for archiving purposes, and is not currently active.

## Okay, but what's the project?
It is a prototype for a messaging app. This repo would likely run on a server or website, and allow users to interface with its terminal.
It displays programming in python, including: reading and writing to textfiles, utilizing classes, and using outside modules (Including argon2, for hashing).
It also using basic SQL for database management.
